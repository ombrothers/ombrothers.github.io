			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="verseline">In sooth, I know not why I am so sad</p>
			<p class="verseline">It wearies me; you say it wearies you; </p>
			<p class="verseline">But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, </p>
			<p class="verseline">What stuff ‘tis made of, whereof it is born, </p>
			<p class="verseline">I am to learn; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And such a want-wit sadness makes of me </p>
			<p class="verseline">That I have much ado to know myself</p>
			<p class="character">Salerio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Your mind is tossing on the ocean; </p>
			<p class="verseline">There where your argosies, with portly sail- </p>
			<p class="verseline">Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Or as it were the pageants of the sea- </p>
			<p class="verseline">Do overpeer the petty traffickers, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That curtsy to them, do them reverence, </p>
			<p class="verseline">As they fly by them with their woven wings</p>
			<p class="character">Solanio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, </p>
			<p class="verseline">The better part of my affections would </p>
			<p class="verseline">Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still </p>
			<p class="verseline">Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Peering in maps for ports, and piers, and roads; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And every object that might make me fear </p>
			<p class="verseline">Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Would make me sad</p>
			<p class="character">Salerio </p>
			<p class="verseline">My wind, cooling my broth, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Would blow me to an ague when I thought </p>
			<p class="verseline">What harm a wind too great might do at sea</p>
			<p class="verseline">I should not see the sandy hour-glass run </p>
			<p class="verseline">But I should think of shallows and of flats, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And see my wealthy Andrew dock’d in sand, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Vailing her high top lower than her ribs </p>
			<p class="verseline">To kiss her burial. Should I go to church </p>
			<p class="verseline">And see the holy edifice of stone, </p>

			<p class="verseline">And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought </p>
			<p class="verseline">To think on this, and shall I lack the thought </p>
			<p class="verseline">That such a thing bechanc’d would make me sad? </p>
			<p class="verseline">But tell not me; I know Antonio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is sad to think upon his merchandise</p>
			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it, </p>
			<p class="verseline">My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate </p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon the fortune of this present year; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad</p>

			<p class="character">Solanio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad </p>
			<p class="verseline">Because you are not merry; and ‘twere as easy </p>
			<p class="verseline">For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nature hath fram’d strange fellows in her time: </p>
			<p class="verseline">Some that will evermore peep through their eyes, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper; </p>

			<p class="verseline">Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman, </p>

			<p class="verseline">My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, </p>
			<p class="verseline">We two will leave you; but at dinner-time, </p>
			<p class="verseline">I pray you, have in mind where we must meet</p>
			<p class="character">Bassanio </p>

			<p class="verseline">Believe me, you are marvellously chang’d</p>
			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="verseline">I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano- </p>
			<p class="verseline">A stage, where every man must play a part, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And mine a sad one</p>
			<p class="character">Gratiano </p>
			<p class="verseline">Let me play the fool</p>
			<p class="verseline">With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And let my liver rather heat with wine </p>
			<p class="verseline">Than my heart cool with mortifying groans</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why should a man whose blood is warm within </p>
			<p class="verseline">Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice </p>
			<p class="verseline">By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio- </p>
			<p class="verseline">I love thee, and ‘tis my love that speaks- </p>
			<p class="verseline">There are a sort of men whose visages </p>
			<p class="verseline">Do cream and mantle like a standing pond, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And do a wilful stillness entertain, </p>
			<p class="verseline">With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit; </p>
			<p class="verseline">As who should say ‘I am Sir Oracle, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.’ </p>
			<p class="verseline">O my Antonio, I do know of these </p>
			<p class="verseline">That therefore only are reputed wise </p>
			<p class="verseline">For saying nothing; when, I am very sure, </p>
			<p class="verseline">If they should speak, would almost damn those ears </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools</p>
			<p class="verseline">I’ll tell thee more of this another time</p>
			<p class="verseline">But fish not with this melancholy bait </p>
			<p class="verseline">For this fool gudgeon, this opinion</p>
			<p class="verseline">Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile; </p>
			<p class="verseline">I’ll end my exhortation after dinner</p>
			<p class="character">Lorenzo </p>
			<p class="verseline">Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time</p>
			<p class="verseline">I must be one of these same dumb wise men, </p>
			<p class="verseline">For Gratiano never lets me speak</p>
			<p class="character">Gratiano </p>
			<p class="verseline">Well, keep me company but two years moe, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue</p>
			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Fare you well; I’ll grow a talker for this gear</p>
			<p class="character">Gratiano </p>
			<p class="verseline">Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable </p>
			<p class="verseline">In a neat’s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible</p>
			<p class="exunt">Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo </p>
			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="prose">Is that anything now? </p>
			<p class="character">Bassanio </p>
			<p class="prose">Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in, two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the search</p>
			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Well; tell me now what lady is the same </p>
			<p class="verseline">To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That you to-day promis’d to tell me of? </p>
			<p class="character">Bassanio </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis not unknown to you, Antonio, </p>
			<p class="verseline">How much I have disabled mine estate </p>
			<p class="verseline">By something showing a more swelling port </p>
			<p class="verseline">Than my faint means would grant continuance; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor do I now make moan to be abridg’d </p>
			<p class="verseline">From such a noble rate; but my chief care </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is to come fairly off from the great debts </p>
			<p class="verseline">Wherein my time, something too prodigal, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Hath left me gag’d. To you, Antonio, </p>
			<p class="verseline">I owe the most, in money and in love; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And from your love I have a warranty </p>
			<p class="verseline">To unburden all my plots and purposes </p>
			<p class="verseline">How to get clear of all the debts I owe</p>
			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="verseline">I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And if it stand, as you yourself still do, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Within the eye of honour, be assur’d </p>
			<p class="verseline">My purse, my person, my extremest means, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Lie all unlock’d to your occasions</p>
			<p class="character">Bassanio </p>
			<p class="verseline">In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft, </p>
			<p class="verseline">I shot his fellow of the self-same flight </p>
			<p class="verseline">The self-same way, with more advised watch, </p>
			<p class="verseline">To find the other forth; and by adventuring both </p>
			<p class="verseline">I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Because what follows is pure innocence</p>
			<p class="verseline">I owe you much; and, like a wilful youth, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That which I owe is lost; but if you please </p>
			<p class="verseline">To shoot another arrow that self way </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt, </p>
			<p class="verseline">As I will watch the aim, or to find both, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Or bring your latter hazard back again </p>
			<p class="verseline">And thankfully rest debtor for the first</p>
			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="verseline">You know me well, and herein spend but time </p>
			<p class="verseline">To wind about my love with circumstance; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And out of doubt you do me now more wrong </p>
			<p class="verseline">In making question of my uttermost </p>
			<p class="verseline">Than if you had made waste of all I have</p>
			<p class="verseline">Then do but say to me what I should do </p>
			<p class="verseline">That in your knowledge may by me be done, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And I am prest unto it; therefore, speak</p>
			<p class="character">Bassanio </p>
			<p class="verseline">In Belmont is a lady richly left, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And she is fair and, fairer than that word, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes </p>
			<p class="verseline">I did receive fair speechless messages</p>
			<p class="verseline">Her name is Portia- nothing undervalu’d </p>
			<p class="verseline">To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia</p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth; </p>
			<p class="verseline">For the four winds blow in from every coast </p>
			<p class="verseline">Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks </p>
			<p class="verseline">Hang on her temples like a golden fleece, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos’ strond, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And many Jasons come in quest of her</p>
			<p class="verseline">O my Antonio, had I but the means </p>
			<p class="verseline">To hold a rival place with one of them, </p>
			<p class="verseline">I have a mind presages me such thrift </p>
			<p class="verseline">That I should questionless be fortunate</p>
			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea; </p>

			<h2 class="scene"><span class="allscenes"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>Scene II</span></h2>
			<h2 class="location">Belmont. Portia’s house </h2>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Portia with her waiting-woman, Nerissa </h2>
			<p class="character">Portia </p>
			<p class="prose">By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world</p>
			<p class="character">Nerissa </p>
			<p class="prose">You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are; and yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean: superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer</p>
			<p class="character">Portia </p>
			<p class="prose">Good sentences, and well pronounc’d</p>
			<p class="character">Nerissa </p>
			<p class="prose">They would be better, if well followed</p>
			<p class="character">Portia </p>
			<p class="prose">If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o’er a cold decree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word ‘choose’! I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curb’d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none? </p>
			<p class="character">Nerissa </p>
			<p class="prose">Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations; therefore the lott’ry that he hath devised in these three chests, of gold, silver, and lead- whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you- will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come? </p>
			<p class="character">Portia </p>
			<p class="prose">I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest them, I will describe them; and according to my description, level at my affection</p>
			<p class="character">Nerissa </p>
			<p class="prose">First, there is the Neapolitan prince</p>
			<p class="character">Portia </p>
			<p class="prose">Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself; I am much afear’d my lady his mother play’d false with a smith</p>
			<p class="character">Nerissa </p>
			<p class="prose">Then is there the County Palatine</p>
			<p class="character">Portia </p>
			<p class="prose">He doth nothing but frown, as who should say ‘An you will not have me, choose.’ He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death’s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two! </p>
			<p class="character">Nerissa </p>
			<p class="prose">How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon? </p>
			<p class="character">Portia </p>
			<p class="prose">God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he- why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man. If a throstle sing he falls straight a-cap’ring; he will fence with his own shadow; if I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him; for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him</p>
			<p class="character">Nerissa </p>
			<p class="prose">What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England? </p>

He is a proper man’s picture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere</p>

			<p class="character">Portia </p>

When he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. An the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him</p>

			<p class="prose">You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords; they have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father’s imposition, depending on the caskets</p>

But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves- I mean pirates; and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats- I think I may take his bond</p>

Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries; if I serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare fortune!

			<p class="character">Shylock </p>
			<p class="prose">There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto; a beggar, that was us’d to come so smug upon the mart. Let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond. He was wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him look to his bond</p>
			<p class="character">Salerio </p>
			<p class="prose">Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh. What’s that good for? </p>
			<p class="character">Shylock </p>
			<p class="prose">To bait fish withal. If it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgrac’d me and hind’red me half a million; laugh’d at my losses, mock’d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies. And what’s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? </p>
			<p class="prose">Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions, fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? </p>
			<p class="prose">If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? </p>
			<p class="prose">Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me I will execute; and itshall go hard but I will better the instruction</p>

			<p class="character">Shylock </p>
			<p class="prose">Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone, cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it till now. Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; would she were hears’d at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin! No news of them? Why, so- and I know not what’s spent in the search. Why, thou- loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge; nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o’ my shoulders; no sighs but o’ my breathing; no tears but o’ my shedding! </p>

			<p class="prose">There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break</p>
			<p class="character">Shylock </p>
			<p class="prose">I am very glad of it; I’ll plague him, I’ll torture him; I am glad of it</p>
			<p class="character">Tubal </p>
			<p class="prose">One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey</p>
			<p class="character">Shylock </p>
			<p class="prose">Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor; I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys</p>
			<p class="character">Tubal </p>
			<p class="prose">But Antonio is certainly undone</p>
			<p class="character">Shylock </p>
			<p class="prose">Nay, that’s true; that’s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I will. Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue; go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal</p>

			<p class="verseline">I lose your company; therefore forbear a while</p>
			<p class="verseline">There’s something tells me- but it is not love- </p>

			<p class="verseline">And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought- </p>
			<p class="verseline">I would detain you here some month or two </p>
			<p class="verseline">Before you venture for me. I could teach you </p>

			<p class="verseline">So will I never be; so may you miss me; </p>
			<p class="verseline">But if you do, you’ll make me wish a sin, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes! </p>

			<p class="character">Bassanio </p>

			<p class="verseline">So may the outward shows be least themselves; </p>
			<p class="verseline">The world is still deceiv’d with ornament</p>
			<p class="verseline">In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt </p>
			<p class="verseline">But, being season’d with a gracious voice, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Obscures the show of evil? In religion, </p>
			<p class="verseline">What damned error but some sober brow </p>

			<p class="verseline">There is no vice so simple but assumes </p>

			<p class="verseline">A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave; </p>

			<p class="verseline">As from her lord, her governor, her king</p>
			<p class="verseline">Myself and what is mine to you and yours </p>

			<p class="verseline">Rating myself at nothing, you shall see </p>
			<p class="verseline">How much I was a braggart. When I told you </p>
			<p class="verseline">My state was nothing, I should then have told you </p>
			<p class="verseline">That I was worse than nothing; for indeed </p>
			<p class="verseline">I have engag’d myself to a dear friend, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Engag’d my friend to his mere enemy, </p>
			<p class="verseline">To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady, </p>
			<p class="verseline">The paper as the body of my friend, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And every word in it a gaping wound </p>
			<p class="verseline">Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio? </p>
			<p class="verseline">Hath all his ventures fail’d? What, not one hit? </p>
